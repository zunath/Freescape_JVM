It serves as a replacement for NWScript and handles most server features and functions. This is possible by using the NWNX_JVM plugin for NWNX.

# Quick-start guide for Freescape server developers

1.) Install Git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

2.) Install IntelliJ Community Edition (NOT Ultimate!) from here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

3.) Start up IntelliJ

4.) Click the "Check out from Version Control" option.

5.) Select GitHub

6.) Enter in the following:

Git Repository URL: https://github.com/zunath/Freescape_JVM.git

Parent Directory: Select a location on your hard drive where you want to store your projects or leave it as the default.

Directory Name: Freescape_JVM

7.) Click Clone and wait until it finishes downloading the files.

# Hosting Dependencies

1.) Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Server Files

2.) Linux OS

3.) NWNX + the following plugins: Chat, Creature, Events, JVM, Object, Player

4.) OpenJDK 8 JRE

5.) Microsoft SQL Server 2017

# Using Docker

I highly recommend using Docker to speed up development time. You can read about how to use it for NWN:EE here: https://hub.docker.com/r/nwnxee/nwserver/

It'll take care of hosting dependencies #1-#4. You only need to set up the SQL Server database at that point.
